### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Let's do a summary for what's actually is "about me" and about my life right now :) 

I've had a passion for coding since a young age. It all started with QBasic. During the last 12 years, I've been mainly working with other things but the software development was still part of those 12 years. I've been developing internal tools to speed our process and cut down on human errors.   

After 12 years working with Apple Service, I've decided it's time to work with what drives me forward and makes me excited. That is a software solution with a combination of hardware. Tech is within my blood. 

The last few months I've spent doing a software development extension course. The course covers C#, ASP .NET, React, Azure.  

A proof that I can take care of things is that I haven't killed the plants at home yet ;)   

No, let's be serious for a moment. Hopefully, you will find me of interest and want to talk more. And who says no to some free help :).
